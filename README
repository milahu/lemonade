Lemonade is a Python port of the LEMON Parser Generator written by
D. Richard Hipp:

    http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/

Lemonade can be used in the traditional fashion to create a standalone
parser:

    lemonade gram.y

The above command generates "gram.py", which you can include in your
project.

Since Python is a dynamic language, Lemonade could also enable client
software to generate a parser from a user-supplied .y file, and then
use the generated parser on the fly.

This is the beta release of Lemonade.  There is no documentation yet.
You may find the original LEMON documentation helpful:

However, many of LEMON's "%" directives are irrelevant in Python;
therefore, they have been eliminated in Lemonade.  Further, Lemonade
does not allow code fragments ("{}") within the grammar file.
Instead, the reduce actions are specified in a separate delegate
class.  See the 'examples' directory for an example.
